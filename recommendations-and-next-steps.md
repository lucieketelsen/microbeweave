# Recommendations and Next steps

There is a lot of creative potential within these tools. 

Some elements worth taking forward are:

* translation of tracking metrics into computational design space in order to create digital 'sculptures'
* iterative thresholding as a layered approach to image creation
* using GANs as a means of generating synthetic microbial capture images
* using GANs as a textile design tool
* NLP as a textile design tool, where weave/lace structures are coded as text values
