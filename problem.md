How to work creatively within computational workflows? 

This project considered ways of 'contaminating' traditional hand weaving samples with microbial growth patterns. As is often the case with creative projects, the central issue is rarely that of problem solving, but rather problem finding.  

The project is composed of several 'problems':

* compile original dataset from existing images
* create images from microscopy captures
* derive image frames from time lapse microscopy video
* clean, resize and format images as datasets
* segment and transform microscopy frames \(data augmentation\) to expand dataset size
* increase resolution or map features of frame segments derived from microscopy
* 
Initially, while reading over P.Mital's CADL course material, I thought transfer learning might be appropriate.
